                        So this was 3rd day of Eid night time we had talked for almost 5 hours non stop talking about different topics first  we talked about how we would react to our first night of sex. It was pretty helpful talking to someone about it cause this felt like a bigger deal What should we do to respect each other. 
Then we discussed introvert and extrovert and how fake we are on the internet and we don't know if our real personality or the real world personality is our own personality. By the end of it i felt like we were so connected to each other more then anytime we have talked before and yes i have felt this many times before but not to this extent.  Like i really felt so connected to her in that moment cause never in my life i have been this intimate and comfortable with.
soi thought of asking if she would ever date me  and i know that date is not the correct word cause I'm pretty serious about this thing but using date word makes it feel easy to ask and i have wondered this question many times but i was never this close to almost type it and was literally just  typing away from asking her. I even practiced my voice notes so i could talk to her on voice call making it a serious thing not like a jole between us but in the end i still couldn't ask her.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-amber-50/90 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-2s">
                        And the thing is i couldn't sent her that message cause i know she haven't gave me any signal whatsoever I'm waiting this whole this one time she gives me any signal and i finally ask her. I think i have few times gave her signal but she thinks I'm flirting in joke. And i know if this goes wrong this friendship we have is gone so the risk is too much cause I don't think i ever had a best friend like this and sometimes i think my not telling is good cause this good of a friendship comes once in life and the risk is definitely not worth losing the friendship. And now one day later I'm still thinking here that I was this close to asking her away and god knows how long it'll take for me to get back that level of courage again.


But the day after eid was the day i think i tried my best for her to tell me something or give me any signal cause I'm pretty sure i was very bold with my words this conversation started with she saying she wanted to talk about something important she said
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-amber-50/90 leading-relaxed text-lg animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-3s">
                        "u know there was this topic very important i wanted to discuss"

So i made a joke that would lean into what i wanted her to say i joked
 "My answer is No 🙂‍↔️ sorry I'm already Married ✋🏻"

so afterwards she said she forgot what she wanted to say
"kaha nai yadh nai sochoon gi shyd a jai yadh"

 and then I started talking in a to make her comfortable enough for her to talk i persuaded her to just say it don't hold back

  "Chal mai wait kr leta hoon"
"Chal phir bol de I'm all ears "
"Bol le kuch nhi kahon ga"
"Baat na ghuma seedha bol le"
"Chal jis language mai easy lagta hai bol le"
"Baat mat taal"
"Ab tere khne pe mene chor dya wrna mai fully ready tha"
"Mai koshis kr rha tha tujhe yaad aa jaye lakin tune koshis hi nhi ki"
"Baat hai to bta de hesitate mat kr"
"Chal thik hai I'll wait"
"Mai kab se pressure kum kr rha hoom
"I'm gonna believe you choose to not tell me"

But she really didn't say anything that makes me wonder was she really thinking what i was thinking if not then what would make her think that way
