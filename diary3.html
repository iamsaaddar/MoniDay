                        So finally today was the day i finally said it the day was going pretty normal we weren't like talking that deep but later i was just kinda feeling down and the conversation started to shift i was getting back into my feelings and in a way i forcefully tried to make it easy for me by saying her that i was disappointed in this way she would keep pushing me to say it and I'll use that push to say what i wanted to say and it worked she kept asking me to say and when she was said

 "Just say u can't..I'll live with that"

That really gave me the courage to speak and i said 

"Alright i like you that's all"
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-green-100/90 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-2s">
                        And the next moment i felt my hand trembling i left the chat don't know why like i thought she might don't see me here outside the chat and when i saw her typing i was counting mini seconds waiting for what's she gonna say cause in my mind what was gonna happen is 
... she might at first not take it serious
.... She might just get uncomfortable and leave 
......(My worse fear) She might get weirded and block me 
...... She might just leave it at see  and wait for 2 or 3 days to think about it 
But she just said tell me about those other things and that just gave me the biggest relief cause in my mind that meant a yes 

And here's my full confession that took me ages to say 



Then I don't know why she would think i care about her looks like every time i have thought of her not one single time never ever i thought "oh what if she isn't pretty" like bro but if I'm being honest if that was insecurity then i shouldn't be glad but I'm glad cause I'm also hella insecure and that means we have that thing in common
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-green-100/90 leading-relaxed text-lg animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-3s">
                        And now I'm just nitpicking but she said " it's obvious i feel the same way" i rather hear her say it but i don't mind i get the sentiment. Plus Jab Poora Sumandar mil jaye to chota talaab na milne pr complain nhi krna chahye.

Plus she has a folder about me 😍😍😍 that's the cutest thing ever like now I'm mad i didn't made a folder for her...

And don't get too excited this chapter ain't all positive i do have a complain with myself i got too excited and started talking a lot and didn't let her talk much that was too much need to get in control dumbo... Now you can be happy 😊 
And then she admitted that she was the one behind the call which i already told you it was her see my instincts were right.....

Then i told her about the previous entry in this diary 
And just writing before this I'm already giggling cause no way I actually told her about the boo boo part 😚😚
She also liked that can you believe ts too good to ne true like on god she said she liked it lemme grab ss cause this deserves one 



And she said she started liking me way before i ever did i wanted to argue that (stupid me) but in reality I don't even remember the point I started having feelings for her cause all i remember is a point where i was about to express my feelings and that goes back to the eid.

And she thought ke mai koi playboy hoon on god she don't no about me 😭




Then she told me she was gonna confess back when I gave her the opportunity. You know how easy it would have been for me like it would have saved me so much stress but again that would be a pussy move on my behalf and i I'm glad i was the one who siad it first.



And I'm finding out she was super super mad about the bag conversation so saadi keep in mind choose words wisely and pay attention to what's she saying..


😗 She felt happy knowing that i wanted her number take that for a win "i felt delulu for a week knowing that he wanted my number"

I forgot to ask her about the dream she had which made her start liking me so in future i might ask that dream 


Then we did a funny banter where i asked her to ask me my number then i realized how stupid i must sound so i asked her for her number cause don't know why this shit felt personal to me so i asked in a way that was honest and funny by saying 
"I was like thinking that Whatsapp is more personal then Instagram so can i get your number don't worry o won't call I don't ever have balance'
And she gave me her number 0315 6401122

Wait wait the best moment happened in the end 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭  the night couldn't have ended in more better way then this 





This is how the perfect night ended and I'm hoping i wake up and it's not just some dream like already had twice. Or i wake up and she has called the police on me 😭bye bye saadiiiiiiiiiii
