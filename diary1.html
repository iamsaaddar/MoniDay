                        It was Eid Day and it's so fuckin depressing cause i ruined this day already and i don't know what happened or why i got so emotional. I was gonna send her an Eid Mubarak message but I don't kmow why that situation made me so angry it wasn't even her fault i was just angry cause I didn't had the guts to tell her that i like her more then friend and if you would like date me if we met in real life. So what actually happened is that when i saw other people romantically wishing eid Mubarak to their partners and i had this feeling of saying it to her i also wanted to but since i couldn't that made me angry and my dumbass decided not to send any message in anger or spite and i know my anger at her is stupid but it was based on that why she haven't gave me any signal she should atleast know by now. I kmow it's stupid but that just i thought at the moment

                    <p class="text-amber-50/90 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-2s">
                        So later the day we didn't talk I don't know she wasn't active on social media i was tweeting on Twitter replying her but she didn't reply or interacted with me at all. I know something was up cause she was active but was ignoring to intract with my tweets that is super fuckin hurtful you know . So i continued replying to her until she finally replied once said "atleast banda eid Mubarak kh deta hai instead" that's when i kmew she was angry so my dumbass lied and tried to frame it in such a way where i acted like i sent eid message but your Instagram didn't deliver and when she asked me to send ss and then i was gonna edit a picture but instead i just apologized and said i tried to sent everyone but forgot clicking your profile but by her messenges i knew she still was pissed cause when i asked why didn't she wish me Eid Mubarak? She cold heartily said "same thing as yours happened to me" and i knew she's pissed i tried to make it joke and said "what a coincidence" but she never replied and i knew she was angry but that actually made me feel good cause that anger meant she wanted me to send her a Eid wish and that i was important enough to her that she expected it from me and then the turmoil started cause i was now finally getting ready to tell her why i didn't send a message and tell her cause i was angry and wanted to ask her that question

                    <p class="text-amber-50/90 leading-relaxed text-lg animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-3s">
                        I was literally this close and i mean this close to asking her. I so wanted for her to talk to me so i can ask her but i still couldn't find the guts to ask her and i wanted to write this just so i know literally how close i was ti asking her and i feel like this was the closet ever i got to telling her and this was the first time i actually felt so hurt cause she wasn't talking to me and like always that stupid thought happened again oh what if she just blocks and then it's so totally over i fuckin fear that block button a lot
